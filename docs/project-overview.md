# Project Overview

## ATHENA: Autonomous Transformer-Based Heuristic Extending Natural-Language Assistant

ATHENA is an open-source AI smart voice assistant speaker designed to outperform current commercial alternatives with greater privacy, customization, and intelligence. Built around a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central processing unit, ATHENA combines custom hardware design with advanced AI processing capabilities.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

- **Superior Performance**: Outperform Amazon Echo and Google Home in voice recognition and response quality
- **Open Source**: Fully open hardware and software for community development and customization
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design for future upgrades and feature additions

### Key Features
- **6-Microphone Array**: Superior voice capture with noise cancellation
- **Local AI Processing**: Whisper for speech recognition, local LLM for intelligence, Piper for TTS
- **Custom Hardware**: Purpose-built PCB for audio amplification and power management
- **LED Feedback System**: Visual indicators for system status and interaction
- **Web Interface**: Configuration and control through web browser
- **Skills Framework**: Extensible plugin system for adding new capabilities

## Hardware Architecture

### Core Components
- **Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)**: Main processing unit ($55)
- **ReSpeaker 6-Mic Array**: High-quality voice capture ($35)
- **Custom PCB**: Audio amplification and power management ($25)
- **Speaker System**: Mid-range driver + tweeter for clear audio output ($45)
- **Custom Enclosure**: 3D printed case with optimal acoustics ($30)
