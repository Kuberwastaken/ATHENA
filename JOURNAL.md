# May 22nd, 2025: Project Kickoff

Today marks the beginning of Project ATHENA, my ambitious attempt to build a smarter, more capable voice assistant than what's currently available commercially. I've been frustrated with the limitations of my Echo Dot - it works for simple commands but falls short on anything complex. With recent advances in AI, I believe we can do much better with open hardware.

I began by researching existing open-source voice assistant projects to understand their architectures and limitations. I looked at:
- Mycroft AI's hardware and software stack
- Various ReSpeaker implementations
- Custom Raspberry Pi voice assistant builds

Key takeaways from this research:
- Wake word detection is a significant challenge for reliability
- Microphone array quality dramatically affects voice recognition accuracy
- Audio output quality is often overlooked but crucial for user experience
- Local AI processing requires careful optimization for the hardware

Next, I drafted a preliminary bill of materials and started sketching some initial designs for the hardware layout. I'm particularly excited about incorporating a 6-mic array for superior voice detection and designing a custom case with proper acoustic properties.

For the software stack, I'm planning to use a combination of:
- Local wake word detection (likely Porcupine or a custom solution)
- A local language model for basic commands
- Cloud fallback for more complex queries (with user permission)
