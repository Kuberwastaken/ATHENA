# ATHENA Software Architecture

This directory contains the software components for the ATHENA voice assistant project.

## System Architecture

ATHENA's software stack consists of several key components:

1. **Audio Processing Pipeline**
   - Microphone array interface
   - Audio preprocessing (noise reduction, echo cancellation)
   - Wake word detection

2. **Voice Assistant Core**
   - Speech-to-text processing
   - Natural language understanding
   - Intent classification
   - Response generation

3. **Knowledge & Skills System**
   - Core functionality modules
   - Extensible skill framework
   - API integrations

4. **Hardware Interface Layer**
   - LED control
   - Speaker management
   - Display interface
   - Button/input handling

5. **Configuration & Management**
   - Web-based configuration interface
   - Over-the-air updates
   - Diagnostic tools

## Key Components

### Audio Processing

The audio processing system handles:

- Interfacing with the ReSpeaker microphone array
- Audio preprocessing for noise reduction
- Wake word detection using a lightweight local model
- Audio output management

### Voice Assistant Core

The core assistant functionality includes:

- Local speech-to-text processing for basic commands
- Optional cloud-based STT for more complex speech
- Natural language understanding
- Context-aware conversation management
- Text-to-speech synthesis

### Skills Framework

The extensible skills framework allows for:

- Core functionality (time, weather, reminders, etc.)
- Music playback integration
- Smart home control
- Custom skill development

### Web Configuration

A web-based interface allows for:

- Device configuration
- Skill management
- Performance monitoring
- Update management

## Technology Stack

ATHENA's software is built using:

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **PyTorch** - For local AI models
- **FastAPI** - Web API framework
- **WebRTC** - Audio streaming (for web interface)
- **React** - Web interface frontend

## Local vs. Cloud Processing

ATHENA is designed with privacy in mind:

- Wake word detection runs entirely locally
- Basic commands are processed locally
- More complex queries can optionally use cloud services
- User has full control over what data leaves the device

## Development Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- Wake word detection engine
- Audio processing pipeline
- Basic skill framework

*Code will be added as it is developed.*
