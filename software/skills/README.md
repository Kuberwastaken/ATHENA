# Skills Framework

This directory contains the skills framework and individual skills for the ATHENA voice assistant.

## Architecture

The skills framework uses a modular, plugin-based architecture:

- Skills register with the core assistant
- Each skill defines intents it can handle
- The core assistant routes requests to appropriate skills
- Skills return structured responses
- The core assistant renders the responses

## Core Skills

- `system/`: System control and information
- `time/`: Time, date, and calendar functions
- `weather/`: Weather forecasting and conditions
- `knowledge/`: General knowledge questions
- `music/`: Music playback control

## Extensibility

The framework is designed for easy extension:

- Skills are loaded dynamically at runtime
- New skills can be added without modifying core code
- Skills can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Skills can define their own configuration options

## Skill Structure

Each skill consists of:

- `__init__.py`: Skill registration and metadata
- `intents.py`: Intent definitions and handlers
- `api.py`: External API integrations (if needed)
- `models/`: Any data models used by the skill
- `settings.py`: Configuration options

## API Integration

Skills can integrate with external APIs:

- Authentication handling
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- Error handling

## Development Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- Core skill framework design
- Basic system skills
- Time and weather skills

*Code will be added as it is developed.*
