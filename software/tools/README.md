# Development Tools

This directory contains tools for developing and testing the ATHENA voice assistant.

## Components

- `setup.py`: Development environment setup
- `test/`: Automated testing framework
- `simulator/`: Device simulation for testing
- `benchmark/`: Performance benchmarking tools
- `debug/`: Debugging utilities

## Development Environment

The setup tools help create a consistent development environment:

- Virtual environment setup
- Dependency installation
- Development configuration

## Testing Framework

The testing framework includes:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end functionality
- Mock services for external dependencies

## Simulator

The simulator allows testing without hardware:

- Virtual microphone input
- Virtual speaker output
- Simulated LED and display
- Test scenario automation

## Benchmarking

Performance benchmarking tools measure:

- Wake word detection accuracy and speed
- Speech recognition performance
- Response generation time
- Overall system latency
- Memory and CPU usage

## Debugging

Debugging utilities include:

- Enhanced logging
- Real-time data visualization
- State inspection tools
- Audio analysis tools

## Dependencies

- pytest
- mock
- pytest-benchmark
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Usage

To set up the development environment:

```
cd tools
python setup.py develop
```

To run the test suite:

```
pytest
```

To run the simulator:

```
python simulator/run.py
```

## Development Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- Basic testing framework
- Development environment setup
- Simple simulator functionality

*Code will be added as it is developed.*
