# Hardware Interface

This directory contains the hardware interface components for the ATHENA voice assistant.

## Components

- `led.py`: LED control for visual feedback
- `buttons.py`: Button input handling
- `display.py`: Display interface (if equipped)
- `power.py`: Power management functions
- `sensors.py`: Additional sensor interfaces

## LED Interface

The LED control system:

- Controls the LED ring/strip for visual feedback
- Provides status indications (listening, processing, etc.)
- Supports animations and effects
- Uses PWM for brightness control

## Button Interface

Button handling includes:

- Physical button input detection
- Long-press and multi-press detection
- Customizable button functions
- Button debouncing

## Display Interface

For models with a display:

- Status information display
- Visual responses to queries
- Configuration interface
- Touch input handling (if equipped)

## Power Management

Power management features:

- Power state monitoring
- Sleep mode control
- Hardware component power control
- Power consumption optimization

## Sensors

Optional sensor interfaces:

- Temperature/humidity sensing
- Ambient light detection
- Proximity detection

## Dependencies

- RPi.GPIO
- rpi_ws281x (for LED control)
- Pillow (for display graphics)

## Raspberry Pi Integration

The hardware interfaces are designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi:

- Uses GPIO pins for direct control
- Leverages I2C and SPI for component communication
- Optimizes for the Raspberry Pi's capabilities

## Development Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- LED control system
- Basic button interface
- Display framework

*Code will be added as it is developed.*
