# ATHENA Hardware Design

This directory contains the hardware design files for the ATHENA voice assistant project.

## Overview

The hardware design for ATHENA consists of:

1. **Main Computing Module** - Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)
2. **Audio Input** - Custom microphone array based on the ReSpeaker design
3. **Audio Output** - Custom speaker system with amplification
4. **Power System** - Power management and distribution
5. **User Interface** - LEDs, optional display, and buttons
6. **Custom Enclosure** - Designed for optimal acoustics and aesthetics

## Key Components

### Microphone Array

The microphone array is designed to provide optimal voice capture from across a room. Key features:

- 6 MEMS microphones in a circular arrangement
- DSP for beamforming and noise cancellation
- I2S interface to Raspberry Pi

### Audio Amplification

Custom audio amplification circuit designed for high quality voice reproduction:

- Class D amplifier for energy efficiency
- Stereo output capability
- Volume control via software and hardware

### Power Management

Power management system includes:

- Input protection circuits
- Efficient voltage regulation
- Power distribution to all components

## Design Considerations

### Acoustic Design

The enclosure is designed with acoustics in mind:

- Speaker chamber tuned for voice frequency response
- Microphone positioning for optimal voice capture
- Sound isolation between components

### Thermal Management

Thermal considerations include:

- Ventilation for Raspberry Pi cooling
- Heat dissipation for audio amplifier
- Temperature monitoring

### User Interface

The interface is designed to be intuitive and informative:

- RGB LED ring for status indication
- Optional LCD display for detailed information
- Capacitive touch or physical buttons for direct control

## Future Expansion

The hardware is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for future expansions such as:

- Additional sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Battery backup system
- Enhanced audio capabilities

## Current Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- Finalizing microphone array design
- Acoustic enclosure modeling
- Power system design

*Detailed schematics and PCB layouts will be added as they are developed.*
