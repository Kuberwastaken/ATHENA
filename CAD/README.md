# ATHENA CAD Files

This directory contains the CAD files for the ATHENA voice assistant project.

## Overview

The CAD models in this directory represent the physical design of the ATHENA voice assistant, including:

- Main enclosure
- Speaker mounting
- Microphone array positioning
- Internal component layout
- Assembly instructions

## Directory Structure

- `models/` - 3D models in various formats (STL, STEP, F3D)
- `drawings/` - Technical drawings and dimensions
- `Images/` - Renders and photos of the project

## Design Considerations

### Acoustic Design

The enclosure is designed with acoustics in mind:

- Speaker chamber optimized for voice reproduction
- Microphone positioning for optimal voice capture
- Bass reflex port for improved low frequency response

### Thermal Management

Thermal considerations include:

- Ventilation for Raspberry Pi cooling
- Heat dissipation for audio amplifier
- Strategic component placement to minimize heat issues

### Aesthetics

The external design focuses on:

- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Appropriate size for home/desk placement
- LED diffusion for visual feedback
- Optional display integration

## Manufacturing

The parts are designed to be manufactured using:

- FDM 3D printing for main structure
- Standard fasteners for assembly

## Current Status

This is a work in progress. Current focus is on:

- Initial enclosure design
- Component layout optimization
- Acoustic chamber modeling

*Detailed CAD files will be added as they are developed.*
